# Object_Detection
Deep learning-based object detection with OpenCV


<h2>Python OpenCV object detection</h2>
OpenCV is the huge and open-source library for image processing, machine learning and computer vision. It is also playing an important role in real-time operation. With the help of the OpenCV library, we can easily process the images as well as videos to identify the objects, faces or even handwriting of a human present in the file. We will only focus to object detection from images using OpenCV in this tutorial. We will learn about how we can use OpenCV to do object detection from a given image using a Python program.

</h2>Object Detection</h2>
Basically, object detection is a modern computer technology that is related to image processing, deep learning and computer vision to detect the objects present in an image file. All the technologies used in the Object detection technique (as we mentioned earlier) deals with detecting instances of the object in the image or video.

<h2>Object Detection using OpenCV</h2>
We have learned about object detection in the previous section, and in this section, we will learn that how we can do object detection in an image or video using the OpenCV library. We will first import the OpenCV library in the Python program, and then we will use functions to perform object detection on an image file given to us. But, before using and importing the library functions, let's first install the requirements for using the Object detection technique.
